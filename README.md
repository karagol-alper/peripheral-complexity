Abstract
Understanding how structural complexity influences protein dynamics is crucial for both biophysics and protein design. The relationship between structural complexity and protein stability remains a central question in molecular evolution. Here, we perform a Fourier-based fluctuation analysis on a curated molecular dynamics dataset of 93 alpha-helical proteins, each represented by per-residue root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) profiles across three replicates (ATLAS database). Without requiring predefined structural annotations, we transform RMSF profiles into the frequency domain to quantify the contribution of local, high-frequency motions—commonly associated with peripheral or flexible regions—via developing the High-Frequency Ratio (HFR) metric. Strikingly, we observe a robust inverse correlation between protein length and HFR, indicating that longer proteins exhibit smoother, more coherent dynamics with suppressed local fluctuations. We further revealed a stability variance and size relationship (R=−0.317,p=0.002). The presented method offers a mathematically principled approach to assessing internal compactness and fluctuation topology, with implications for protein engineering, design optimization, and understanding of structure–function relationships. Our findings suggest that the evolution of structural complexity may confer intrinsic stability advantages, implying that natural selection favors topological complexity when it leads to enhanced robustness. This study introduces a mathematically grounded framework for evaluating protein compactness and supports the idea that evolutionary pressure can act on dynamic properties beyond immediate function.
